# Mavis

//TODO: Make this a proper Readme file.

I've decided to open source my pet project that I've started and restarted no less than 5 times since 2014. I still intend on monetizing it if/when I can, but I also want to be transparent so I have decided to open source my current (and final) attempt. Heck, maybe being open source can help me with exposure down the line, I’m not really doing anything new here.

Mavis is a game using a fake stock market based on fantasy points for given players (sold in shares). Before the given sport’s season starts, players are priced according to their projected stats. At the end of the season, players are set to the value of the stats that they achieved. In between, users buy and sell players based on whether they think they are under or overvalued. 

This project is not at an MVP stage yet. I hope to have a closed alpha live before the NBA All-Star Game.
